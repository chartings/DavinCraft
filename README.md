# DavinCraft
Just click Win+R to open run and search curseforge   
Then click minecraft->instances->{your curseforge project}->mods   
put all of these in there and it should work   
broken bad is createbb   

# Disclaimer   
These are not my files, they are all on curseforge for free and I put them on here for easy access because davin messed up so I needed to help Carter out
